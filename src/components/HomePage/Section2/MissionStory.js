                climate change. Looking at the current state of recycling, <span className="Green">the 
                environment is dying.</span> In 2019, there were 53.6 million tonnes of 
                e-waste and only 17.4% were recycled properly.

                Tisâ€™ why we created DemeterDAO: to inject 
                monetary support into individual E-waste centers,
